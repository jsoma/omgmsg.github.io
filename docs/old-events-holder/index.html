<h2 id="january-28-romance-and-revenge-the-history-of-aphrodisiacs-and-poisons-old">January 28: Romance and Revenge: The History of Aphrodisiacs and Poisons (OLD)</h2>

<p>Every culture has a long history of aphrodisiacs – love-inducing and libido-promoting foods, ranging from the commonplace to the esoteric. Is chocolate the rightful king of Valentines Day, or could we do better with a tiger’s unmentionables? Let’s trace the history of these foxy foods and see what science has to say about their amorous assertions.</p>

<p>First comes loves, then comes marriage, then comes a little bit of rat poison in their coffee cup. When love goes wrong, out comes the Victorian obsession with female poisoners: delicate and seductive, these ladies made headlines in the age of yellow journalism for offing their lovers with poisoned food. Come hear their stories and&hellip; hey, does this taste like almonds to you?</p>

Learn why we eat out sushi inside out, and the origins of perennial favorites the California and Philadelphia rolls.</p>

<p>Afterward, Soma will explore the science of sushi. Why is it okay to eat raw fish, and how does that stuff sitting in supermarket displays not send us all right to the emergency room?

We&rsquo;ll delve into in to the past, present and future of three iconic NYC diners close to Sarah&rsquo;s heart: B&amp;H Dairy, Veselka, and Nom Wah Tea Parlor. But don&rsquo;t worry, non-native New Yorkers - we&rsquo;ll be hitting Wattle House, Denny&rsquo;s, and Skyline Chili. Join us for our all-American diner tour!</p>
