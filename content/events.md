You can also check out our [past events](/events/past) if you're curious (there's about a million years of them), or our [podcast](/podcast/) if you just can't wait! 

## July 30: Ice Cream !

I scream, you scream, we all scream for us screaming about **ice cream** at [Caveat](http://caveat.nyc/). It'll be approximately ten zillion degrees outside and we'll all be dying and dying and dying and yearning for that sweet embrace of an icy, milky death.

**Ticket sales ain't up yet, slow your roll.**

## August 27

Mark your calendars! Topic TBD, but it's def going to be at Caveat.
