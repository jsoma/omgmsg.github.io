### food + history + science = this is a *great thing*

When duty calls, Sarah Lohman of [Four Pounds Flour](http://www.fourpoundsflour.com/) and Jonathan Soma of the [Brooklyn Brainery](http://brooklynbrainery.com/) take on a curious food topic and break down the history, science, and stories behind it.

Overall, "Blah blah food blah blah" is a pretty reasonable impression of us.
