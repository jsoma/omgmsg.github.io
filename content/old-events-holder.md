## January 28: Romance and Revenge: The History of Aphrodisiacs and Poisons (OLD)

Every culture has a long history of aphrodisiacs – love-inducing and libido-promoting foods, ranging from the commonplace to the esoteric. Is chocolate the rightful king of Valentines Day, or could we do better with a tiger’s unmentionables? Let’s trace the history of these foxy foods and see what science has to say about their amorous assertions.

First comes loves, then comes marriage, then comes a little bit of rat poison in their coffee cup. When love goes wrong, out comes the Victorian obsession with female poisoners: delicate and seductive, these ladies made headlines in the age of yellow journalism for offing their lovers with poisoned food. Come hear their stories and... hey, does this taste like almonds to you?


## August 27: The Secret History of Sushi (OLD)

**Hosted at Caveat in the LES, [tickets available here](https://www.caveat.nyc/event/the-secret-history-of-sushi-presented-by-masters-of-social-gastronomy)**

Sarah will present a history of sushi in the United States, a bizarre story bathed in celebrity. It took a smash-hit TV mini-series to turn sushi into an everyday “American” food, and now American-style sushi is making splash overseas. Learn why we eat out sushi inside out, and the origins of perennial favorites the California and Philadelphia rolls.

Afterward, Soma will explore the science of sushi. Why is it okay to eat raw fish, and how does that stuff sitting in supermarket displays not send us all right to the emergency room? We’ll also take a peek at sushi rice, from crafting the perfect grain to the the carbohydrate secrets that make it so delightfully sticky.

## April 30: The Secret History of Bodegas (OLD)

Explore the history of bodegas and their connection to the origins of New York City itself. Hear how wave after wave of immigrants – Germans, Dominicans, Koreans, and more – each left their mark upon this New York institution. We’ll also be uncovering stories some of your favorite bodega products. What exactly is hiding in that Boar’s Head deli meat, and why is it the undisputed king of New York sandwiches?

And bodega cats. We’ll definitely be talking about bodega cats.

## July 30: Ice Cream! (OLD)

I scream, you scream, we all scream for us screaming about **ice cream** at [Caveat](http://caveat.nyc/). It'll be approximately ten zillion degrees outside and we'll all be dying and dying and dying and yearning for that sweet embrace of an icy, milky death.
